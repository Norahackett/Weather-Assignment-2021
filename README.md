Read me- 


Weather App - to show the Weather conditions inside and outside 

Weather from Sense hat folder - code for thingspeak and Bylnk 

-Sense hat is used to gather the Temperature/Humidity/Pressure information 
I calibrated the temperature to take into account the CPU temperature 

-Used Pyown libabry to get the rain proability in the next hour. 

-Thingspeak - Publishes the  data every 15mins

-thingspeak - used the information published to get a tweet and email which can be seen in my video 

Pleae create a env File with the below data as I was getting error when sendng to github

username = FhMAKiwhOSITAjIrBTcTByc
clientId = FhMAKiwhOSITAjIrBTcTByc
password = o3a0WRWCLy0VMtZPiH5bZII5
channelId=1558527
transmissionInterval=900
transmissionIntervalhour=3600

Created a Glitch website to show the inside and outside website - using the API from thingsspeak
Glitch Website code saved to main
Glitch - enter your api Key in reading. js line 21 
Thingspeak enter api_key=9NUP3IEFBO0AX1FO to read the channel in dashboard line 18 line  and line 23 reading.js
